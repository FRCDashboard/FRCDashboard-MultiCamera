# FRCDashboard-MultiCamera
Addon to allow toggling between multiple camera views. Great if your robot has a back camera and a front one, or more. cameras.

## Installation
1. If it's not already there, copy the contents of `multicamera.html` to wherever in the dashboard you desire the camera to go.
2. If it's not already there, copy the contents of `multicamera.css` to `style.css` in the dashboard. Of course, you can put it anywhere else you would normally put CSS.
3. If you haven't already, replace the `url` of the `background-image` with your desired default camera view's IP.
4. Copy the sections of `multicamera.js` to where the comments above each section say they should go. Unlike the HTML and CSS, this code should not already be there.
