# FRCDashboard-MultiCamera
Addon to allow toggling between multiple camera views. Great if your robot has a back camera and a front one.

## Installation
1. If it's not already there, copy the contents of `multicamera.html` to wherever in the dashboard you desire the camera to go.
2. Change the src property of the `<img>` to wherever your camera source comes from.
3. If it's not already there, copy the contents of `multicamera.css` to `style.css` in the dashboard. Of course, you can put it anywhere else you would normally put CSS.
4. Copy the sections of `multicamera.js` to where the comments above each section say they should go. Unlike the HTML and CSS, this code should not already be there.
